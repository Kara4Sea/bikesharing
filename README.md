# Citi Bike Ride Trends

## Overview of Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to better understand popular trends of citi bike customers. This includes preferred ride times, ride durations and preferred start and end locations. Furthermore, some analysis is further broken down to understand the impact of gender and user type to ride trends.

## Results

### Visualization
To visualize this analysis, I included seven charts in a Tableau Story to illustrate ride trends.

#### Check out times
The first page of the story includes two visualizations to illustrate popular trip durations, one for checkout times for users and one that elaborates to break down check out times by gender. From these visualizations we can glean that bikes are used for an average of 10 minutes, and that rides drop significantly after one hour. When broken down further by gender, we see that males make up the majority of rides within the first hour, but after one hour passes the ratio evens out amoung male, female and unknown.
