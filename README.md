#### Check out times
The first page of the story includes two visualizations to illustrate popular trip durations, one for checkout times for users and one that elaborates to break down check out times by gender. From these visualizations we can glean that bikes are used for an average of 10 minutes, and that rides drop significantly after one hour. When broken down further by gender, we see that males make up most rides within the first hour, but after one hour passes the ratio evens out among male, female and unknown.

#### Trips per weekday per hour
The second page of the story includes one visualization to illustrate popular days and times for trips. This chart reflects that the most popular times of day at from 8 am to 9am, and from 5pm to 7pm. The most popular day of the week is Thursday, followed by Monday and Tuesday. The illuminates that commuter hours are popular among Citi Bike customers.

#### Trips per weekday per hour by gender
The third page expands on the previous chart by breaking down popular days and time across gender. The chart reflects that male customers make up most rides during popular times.

#### User Types by gender by weekday
The fourth page displays rides by weekday, gender, and user type. This chart reflects that subscribers use rides more often than customers, with male subscribers being the majority of rides. 

#### Locations
The final page reflects two charts pertaining to popular locations - one for starting location and one for ending location. The chart reflects that both starting locations and ending locations follow the same trends for popularity. This is most likely because people are both starting and ending rides in areas with high foot traffic.

## Summary

There are several top-level items we can conclude from this analysis. Those who identify as male make up the majority of the Citi Bike customers as we can see they are the gender who utilizes rides the most per time of day and trip duration. Trips are usually short, with most spanning from 5 to 15 minutes, and rides longer than one hour are not popular. The busiest days and times are commuter times, falling Monday through Friday from 8am to 9am and from 5pm to 7pm. Many Citi Bike customers utilize rides to travel to and from work. Subscribers tend to use rides far more often than customers, meaning the subscription service looks to be working well to retain users. Lastly, high traffic locations are equally popular for starting and stopping.

I would suggest two additional visualizations for future analysis. One to inspect the start and end locations by time and day. It would be interesting to note if some destinations are more busy than normal at certain times. The second would be to inspect user type by gender to understand what gender is most likely to be a subscriber.
